Project Title
Butterfly Species Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Description
This project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to develop a convolutional neural network for classifying butterfly species. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of various butterfly species, aiming to accurately predict the species based on unseen images.
Usage
Project Sections
- Data Loading:Importing the dataset and examining its structure.
- Data Visualization:Visualizing the distribution of butterfly classes using bar charts and pie charts.
- Data Preprocessing:Scaling images and preparing them for training.
- Model Building:Developing a CNN model for classification.
- Model Evaluation:Evaluating the model using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
- Predictions:Displaying predictions on validation data with visualization.

Data:
The dataset used includes images of butterflies categorized into various species. It can be found in the project directory under archive/train.
